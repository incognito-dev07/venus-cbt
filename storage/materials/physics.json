        "content": "<h1>Quantities, Units and Dimensions</h1>\n\n<h2>Introduction to Measurement</h2>\n<p>Physics is a science based upon exact measurement of physical quantities. From the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, we understand the universe by measuring its properties. A measurement consists of two parts: a numerical value and a unit. For example, when we say something is 5 meters long, \"5\" is the numerical value and \"meters\" is the unit. Without units, measurements are meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>A unit is a value, quantity, or magnitude in terms of which other values, quantities, or magnitudes are expressed. Units provide a standard reference that allows measurements to be compared and communicated universally.</p>\n\n<h2>Fundamental Quantities and Units</h2>\n<p>A fundamental quantity (also known as base quantity) is a quantity which cannot be expressed in terms of any other physical quantity. These are the irreducible building blocks from which all other physical quantities are derived. The units in which the fundamental quantities are measured are called fundamental units.</p>\n\n<p>In mechanics, the quantities length, mass, and time are chosen as fundamental quantities because they are independent of each other and form the foundation for describing motion and forces.</p>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='5'>\n<tr><th>Quantity</th><th>Unit</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Length</td><td>Meter</td><td>m</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Kilogram</td><td>kg</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Time</td><td>Second</td><td>s</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2>The International System of Units (S.I.)</h2>\n<p>The S.I. is the culmination of centuries of effort to create a universal measurement system. It consists of seven base or fundamental units, from which all other units are derived:</p>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='5'>\n<tr><th>S/N</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Unit</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1.</td><td>Length</td><td>Meter</td><td>m</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2.</td><td>Mass</td><td>Kilogram</td><td>kg</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3.</td><td>Time</td><td>Second</td><td>s</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4.</td><td>Electric Current</td><td>Ampere</td><td>A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5.</td><td>Temperature</td><td>Kelvin</td><td>K</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6.</td><td>Amount of Substance</td><td>Mole</td><td>mol</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7.</td><td>Luminous Intensity</td><td>Candela</td><td>cd</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>All other physical quantities (like force, energy, pressure, etc.) are derived units, expressed as combinations of these seven base units.</p>\n\n<h2>Concept of Dimension</h2>\n\n<p>The dimension of a physical quantity indicates the fundamental quantities that appear in that quantity and gives absolutely no idea about the magnitude of the quantity. Think of dimensions as the \"type\" of quantity—length, mass, time, etc.—while the unit tells us the specific scale (meters, feet, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>In mechanics, length, mass, and time are taken as the three base dimensions and are expressed by the letters [L], [M], and [T] respectively. A formula which indicates the relation between the derived unit and the fundamental units is called dimensional formula.</p>\n\n<p>The dimensional formula is written with the fundamental dimensions raised to appropriate powers. For example, velocity has dimensions of length divided by time, so its dimensional formula is [LT⁻¹].</p>\n\n<h3>Dimensional Formulas for Common Quantities</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Velocity:</strong> Dimension of Velocity = Dimension of length/Dimension of time = [L]/[T] = [LT⁻¹]</p>\n<p>Hence the dimensional formula for velocity is [M⁰LT⁻¹] (the M⁰ indicates that mass does not appear).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Dimension of Acceleration = Dimension of velocity/Dimension of time = [LT⁻¹]/[T] = [LT⁻²] = [M⁰LT⁻²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Force:</strong> From Newton's second law, F = ma. Dimension of Force = Dimension of mass × Dimension of acceleration = [M] × [LT⁻²] = [MLT⁻²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pressure:</strong> Pressure = Force/Area. Dimension of Pressure = Dimension of Force/Dimension of Area = [MLT⁻²]/[L²] = [ML⁻¹T⁻²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Work (or Energy):</strong> Work = Force × Displacement = [MLT⁻²] × [L] = [ML²T⁻²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> Power = Work/Time = [ML²T⁻²]/[T] = [ML²T⁻³]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modulus of Elasticity (Y):</strong> Y = Stress/Strain. Stress = Force/Area, Strain is dimensionless (ratio of lengths). So Y has same dimensions as stress = [MLT⁻²]/[L²] = [ML⁻¹T⁻²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coefficient of Viscosity (η):</strong> From Newton's law of viscosity, F = ηA(dv/dx). Rearranging: η = (F/A)/(dv/dx). dv/dx has dimensions of velocity/distance = [LT⁻¹]/[L] = [T⁻¹]. So η = ([MLT⁻²]/[L²])/[T⁻¹] = [ML⁻¹T⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Momentum:</strong> p = mv = [M] × [LT⁻¹] = [MLT⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Angular Momentum:</strong> L = mvr = [M] × [LT⁻¹] × [L] = [ML²T⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequency:</strong> f = 1/T = [T⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Area:</strong> [L²]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> [L³]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Density:</strong> ρ = mass/volume = [M]/[L³] = [ML⁻³]</p>\n\n<h2>Use of Dimensional Equations</h2>\n\n<h3>1. To Check the Homogeneity of a Derived Physical Equation</h3>\n\n<p>For an equation to be correct, the dimensions on both sides must be equal. This is called the principle of dimensional homogeneity. If dimensions don't match, the equation is definitely wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Show that the relation for the time period of a simple pendulum T = 2π√(l/g) is dimensionally correct.</p>\n\n<p>Left-hand side (LHS): Dimension of T = [T] (time)</p>\n\n<p>Right-hand side (RHS): √(l/g) = √([L]/[LT⁻²]) = √([L]/([L][T⁻²])) = √(1/[T⁻²]) = √([T²]) = [T]</p>\n\n<p>The factor 2π is dimensionless. So RHS has dimension [T]. Since dimensions of LHS and RHS are equal, the relation is dimensionally correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Check the equation v = u + at for dimensional correctness.</p>\n\n<p>v (velocity): [LT⁻¹]</p>\n<p>u (initial velocity): [LT⁻¹]</p>\n<p>at (acceleration × time): [LT⁻²] × [T] = [LT⁻¹]</p>\n<p>All terms have the same dimensions [LT⁻¹], so the equation is dimensionally correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Test the equation s = ut + ½at².</p>\n\n<p>s (displacement): [L]</p>\n<p>ut: [LT⁻¹] × [T] = [L]</p>\n<p>½at²: [LT⁻²] × [T²] = [L]</p>\n<p>All terms have dimension [L], so equation is dimensionally correct.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Dimensional correctness doesn't guarantee the equation is physically correct (constants could be wrong), but dimensional incorrectness guarantees it's wrong.</p>\n\n<h3>2. To Derive Relationship Between Different Physical Quantities</h3>\n\n<p>Dimensional analysis can help find the form of a physical relationship when we know which quantities are involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the frequency f of a stretched string depends upon the length l of the string, the tension T in the string, and the mass per unit length λ of the string, establish a relation for the frequency.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Write the relationship as f ∝ lˣ Tʸ λᶻ</p>\n<p>Step 2: Write dimensional formulas:</p>\n<p>f has dimension [M⁰L⁰T⁻¹] (frequency is 1/time)</p>\n<p>l has dimension [L]</p>\n<p>T (tension) is force, so dimension [MLT⁻²]</p>\n<p>λ (mass per unit length) has dimension [ML⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p>Step 3: Write the dimensional equation:</p>\n<p>[M⁰L⁰T⁻¹] = [L]ˣ × [MLT⁻²]ʸ × [ML⁻¹]ᶻ</p>\n<p>[M⁰L⁰T⁻¹] = [Mʸ⁺ᶻ] [Lˣ⁺ʸ⁻ᶻ] [T⁻²ʸ]</p>\n\n<p>Step 4: Equate powers of M, L, T:</p>\n<p>For M: 0 = y + z</p>\n<p>For L: 0 = x + y - z</p>\n<p>For T: -1 = -2y ⇒ y = 1/2</p>\n\n<p>Step 5: Solve the equations:</p>\n<p>From y = 1/2 and 0 = y + z: z = -1/2</p>\n<p>From 0 = x + y - z: 0 = x + 1/2 - (-1/2) = x + 1 ⇒ x = -1</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, f ∝ l⁻¹ T¹/² λ⁻¹/² = (1/l)√(T/λ)</p>\n<p>So f = k(1/l)√(T/λ), where k is a dimensionless constant (found to be 1/2 from detailed analysis).</p>\n\n<p>This matches the known formula for the fundamental frequency of a stretched string: f = (1/2l)√(T/μ).</p>\n\n<h3>3. To Derive the Unit of a Physical Quantity</h3>\n\n<p>From the dimensional formula, we can determine the SI unit of a quantity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> From Newton's law of viscosity, F = ηA(dv/dx), obtain the unit for η (coefficient of viscosity).</p>\n\n<p>Rearrange: η = F/(A × dv/dx)</p>\n\n<p>Dimension of η = [MLT⁻²] × [L]/([L²] × [LT⁻¹]/[L])</p>\n<p>= [ML²T⁻²]/([L²] × [T⁻¹]) = [ML²T⁻²]/([L²T⁻¹]) = [ML⁻¹T⁻¹]</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the SI unit of η = kg m⁻¹ s⁻¹ (kilogram per meter per second).</p>\n\n<p>This unit is also called the poiseuille (Pl) in some contexts, but more commonly the poise (P) in CGS system (1 P = 0.1 Pl).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the unit of the gravitational constant G from F = Gm₁m₂/r².</p>\n\n<p>G = Fr²/(m₁m₂)</p>\n<p>Dimension of G = [MLT⁻²] × [L²] / ([M] × [M]) = [M⁻¹L³T⁻²]</p>\n<p>Unit of G = kg⁻¹ m³ s⁻² (or N·m²/kg²)</p"

        "content": "<h1>Vectors</h1>\n\n<h2>Scalars and Vectors</h2>\n\n<p>Physical quantities can generally be classified into two fundamental categories: scalars and vectors. Understanding the difference is crucial for correctly applying physical laws.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scalars</strong> are physical quantities which possess only magnitude and no direction in space. They obey the ordinary rules of arithmetic and algebra. When you add scalars, you simply add their numerical values (e.g., 5 kg + 3 kg = 8 kg).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples of scalars:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mass (e.g., 5 kg) — just how much matter</li>\n<li>Time (e.g., 10 seconds) — duration, no direction</li>\n<li>Temperature (e.g., 25°C) — measure of hotness</li>\n<li>Volume (e.g., 2 liters) — amount of space</li>\n<li>Speed (e.g., 60 km/h) — how fast, but not direction</li>\n<li>Energy (e.g., 100 J) — capacity to do work</li>\n<li>Work (e.g., 50 J) — energy transfer</li>\n<li>Power (e.g., 100 W) — rate of energy transfer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vectors</strong> are physical quantities which have both magnitude and direction in space. They obey vector algebra, which is different from ordinary arithmetic. When adding vectors, direction matters—two vectors of the same magnitude can add to zero if they point in opposite directions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples of vectors:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Force (e.g., 10 N downward) — push or pull with direction</li>\n<li>Velocity (e.g., 20 m/s north) — speed with direction</li>\n<li>Acceleration (e.g., 9.8 m/s² downward) — rate of change of velocity</li>\n<li>Displacement (e.g., 5 m east) — change in position</li>\n<li>Momentum (e.g., 100 kg·m/s forward) — mass in motion</li>\n<li>Weight (e.g., 70 N downward) — gravitational force</li>\n<li>Electric field — force per unit charge with direction</li>\n<li>Magnetic field — direction matters for force on moving charges</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A vector is typically represented graphically as an arrow: the length represents magnitude, and the arrowhead shows direction. In writing, vectors are often denoted by boldface type (A) or with an arrow (Ā).</p>\n\n<h2>Resolution of Vectors</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most powerful techniques in vector analysis is resolving a vector into perpendicular components. This simplifies calculations because components along perpendicular axes are independent and can be treated separately.</p>\n\n<p>A two-dimensional vector can be represented as the sum of two perpendicular vectors called components. Typically, we use horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components.</p>\n\n<p>A vector A can be expressed as:</p>\n<p><strong>A = Aₓ + Aᵧ</strong> or <strong>A = Aₓî + Aᵧĵ</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vectors Aₓ and Aᵧ are called vector components of A. î and ĵ are unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis respectively. A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of exactly 1 and specifies a particular direction without any magnitude information. Unit vectors are like \"pointers\" that indicate direction only.</p>\n\n<p>Let θ be the angle which the vector A makes with the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. Then, using trigonometry:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aₓ = A cos θ</strong> — the component along the x-axis</p>\n<p><strong>Aᵧ = A sin θ</strong> — the component along the y-axis</p>\n\n<p>If we know the components, we can find the magnitude and direction:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magnitude of vector A:</strong> |A| = A = √(Aₓ² + Aᵧ²) — from the Pythagorean theorem</p>\n<p><strong>Direction:</strong> tan θ = Aᵧ/Aₓ, with attention to the quadrant to get the correct angle</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A vector has components Aₓ = 3 units and Aᵧ = 4 units. Find its magnitude and direction.</p>\n<p>Magnitude = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5 units</p>\n<p>tan θ = 4/3 = 1.333, so θ = tan⁻¹(1.333) = 53.1° from the x-axis</p>\n\n<p>In three dimensions, a vector A can be expressed as:</p>\n<p><strong>A = Aₓî + Aᵧĵ + A₂k̂</strong></p>\n<p>where k̂ is the unit vector along the z-axis. The magnitude is:</p>\n<p><strong>|A| = A = √(Aₓ² + Aᵧ² + A₂²)</strong></p>\n<p>The direction is specified by direction cosines: cos α = Aₓ/A, cos β = Aᵧ/A, cos γ = A₂/A, where α, β, γ are the angles with the x, y, and z axes respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Addition and Subtraction of Vectors by Components</h2>\n\n<p>The component method is the most straightforward way to add and subtract vectors. To add vectors, simply add their corresponding components.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If A = 2î + 3ĵ + 4k̂ and B = î + 4ĵ + 5k̂, find:</p>\n\n<p><strong>(a) A + B:</strong></p>\n<p>A + B = (2+1)î + (3+4)ĵ + (4+5)k̂ = 3î + 7ĵ + 9k̂</p>\n<p>|A + B| = √(3² + 7² + 9²) = √(9 + 49 + 81) = √139 ≈ 11.79 units</p>\n\n<p><strong>(b) A - B:</strong></p>\n<p>A - B = (2-1)î + (3-4)ĵ + (4-5)k̂ = î - ĵ - k̂</p>\n<p>|A - B| = √(1² + (-1)² + (-1)²) = √(1 + 1 + 1) = √3 ≈ 1.73 units</p>\n\n<p><strong>(c) 2A + 3B:</strong></p>\n<p>2A = 4î + 6ĵ + 8k̂</p>\n<p>3B = 3î + 12ĵ + 15k̂</p>\n<p>2A + 3B = (4+3)î + (6+12)ĵ + (8+15)k̂ = 7î + 18ĵ + 23k̂</p>\n\n<p>This method works for any number of vectors and is easily programmable.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiplication of Vectors</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike scalar multiplication, vectors can be multiplied in two distinct ways, yielding either a scalar or a vector result. Each type of product has important physical applications.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Dot Product or Scalar Product</h3>\n\n<p>The scalar product of two vectors is defined as the product of the magnitude of two vectors and the cosine of the smaller angle between them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A·B = |A||B| cos θ = AB cos θ</strong></p>\n\n<p>The result is a scalar quantity. The dot product is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum (AB) when vectors are parallel (θ = 0°, cos θ = 1)</li>\n<li>Zero when vectors are perpendicular (θ = 90°, cos θ = 0)</li>\n<li>Minimum (-AB) when vectors are antiparallel (θ = 180°, cos θ = -1)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Physical examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work W = F·d — force times displacement in the direction of force</li>\n<li>Power P = F·v — force times velocity component in force direction</li>\n<li>Electric potential energy U = -p·E for a dipole</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Properties of dot product:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Commutative:</strong> A·B = B·A</li>\n<li><strong>Distributive:</strong> A·(B + C) = A·B + A·C</li>\n<li><strong>Scalar multiplication:</strong> (cA)·B = c(A·B) = A·(cB)</li>\n<li><strong>For unit vectors:</strong> î·î = ĵ·ĵ = k̂·k̂ = 1</li>\n<li><strong>For perpendicular unit vectors:</strong> î·ĵ = ĵ·k̂ = k̂·î = 0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>In component form:</strong> If A = Aₓî + Aᵧĵ + A₂k̂ and B = Bₓî + Bᵧĵ + B₂k̂, then:</p>\n<p>A·B = AₓBₓ + AᵧBᵧ + A₂B₂</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the angle between vectors A = 3î + 4ĵ + 5k̂ and B = 3î + 4ĵ - 5k̂.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Compute dot product: A·B = 3×3 + 4×4 + 5×(-5) = 9 + 16 - 25 = 0</p>\n<p>Step 2: Compute magnitudes: |A| = √(3² + 4² + 5²) = √(9 + 16 + 25) = √50</p>\n<p>|B| = √(3² + 4² + (-5)²) = √(9 + 16 + 25) = √50</p>\n<p>Step 3: cos θ = (A·B)/(|A||B|) = 0/(√50 × √50) = 0 ⇒ θ = 90°</p>\n\n<p>The vectors are perpendicular.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Cross Product or Vector Product</h3>\n\n<p>The vector product of two vectors is defined as a vector having a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of the angle between them, and is in the direction perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors (following the right-hand rule).</p>\n\n<p><strong>A × B = |A||B| sin θ n̂</strong></p>\n\n<p>where n̂ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of vectors A and B. The direction of n̂ is given by the right-hand rule: if fingers of right hand curl from A to B, thumb points in direction of A × B.</p>\n\n<p>The cross product is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum (AB) when vectors are perpendicular (θ = 90°, sin θ = 1)</li>\n<li>Zero when vectors are parallel or antiparallel (θ = 0° or 180°, sin θ = 0)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Physical examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Torque τ = r × F — force times lever arm</li>\n<li>Angular momentum L = r × p — position times momentum</li>\n<li>Magnetic force on moving charge F = q(v × B)</li>\n<li>Area vector of a parallelogram (magnitude = area, direction perpendicular)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Properties of cross product:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-commutative:</strong> A × B = -(B × A)</li>\n<li><strong>Distributive:</strong> A × (B + C) = (A × B) + (A × C)</li>\n<li><strong>Not associative:</strong> (A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C) in general</li>\n<li><strong>For unit vectors:</strong> î × î = ĵ × ĵ = k̂ × k̂ = 0</li>\n<li><strong>Cyclic permutations:</strong> î × ĵ = k̂, ĵ × k̂ = î, k̂ × î = ĵ</li>\n<li><strong>Reverse order gives negative:</strong> ĵ × î = -k̂, k̂ × ĵ = -î, î × k̂ = -ĵ</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>In component form:</strong> Using determinant notation:</p>\n<p>A × B = | î   ĵ   k̂ |</p>\n<p>        | Aₓ Aᵧ A₂ |</p>\n<p>        | Bₓ Bᵧ B₂ |</p>\n<p>= (AᵧB₂ - A₂Bᵧ)î + (A₂Bₓ - AₓB₂)ĵ + (AₓBᵧ - AᵧBₓ)k̂</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find A × B if A = 2î + 3ĵ + 4k̂ and B = î + 2ĵ - 3k̂.</p>\n<p>A × B = (3×(-3) - 4×2)î + (4×1 - 2×(-3))ĵ + (2×2 - 3×1)k̂</p>\n<p>= (-9 - 8)î + (4 + 6)ĵ + (4 - 3)k̂ = -17î + 10ĵ + 1k̂</p>\n\n<p><strong>Geometric interpretation:</strong> The magnitude of cross product |A × B| gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. Half of this gives the area of the triangle formed by them.</p>\n\n<h2>Null Vector (Zero Vector)</h2>\n\n<p>A null vector is a vector whose magnitude is zero. It has no specific direction (or direction is undefined). Properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A + 0 = A (additive identity)</li>\n<li>A × 0 = 0 (cross product with zero vector is zero)</li>\n<li>A · 0 = 0 (dot product with zero vector is zero)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Null vector appears in physics when vector quantities cancel, e.g., the vector sum of all forces on an object in equilibrium is zero.</p>\n\n<h2>Position Vector</h2>\n\n<p>The position vector r is used to specify the position of a particle in space relative to an origin. It is expressed as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>r = xî + yĵ + zk̂</strong></p>\n\n<p>where x, y, z are the scalar coordinates of the particle. The position vector:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starts at the origin and ends at the particle's location</li>\n<li>Changes as the particle moves</li>\n<li>Its magnitude r = √(x² + y² + z²) gives the distance from origin</li>\n<li>Its direction gives the direction from origin to particle</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The displacement vector Δr = r₂ - r₁ represents the change in position, independent of the origin choice.</p>\n\n<h2>Vector Applications in Physics</h2>\n\n<p>Vectors are essential throughout physics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kinematics:</strong> Position, velocity, acceleration as vectors</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamics:</strong> Forces, momentum, impulse as vectors</li>\n<li><strong>Rotational motion:</strong> Angular velocity, torque, angular momentum as vectors (axial vectors)</li>\n<li><strong>Electromagnetism:</strong> Electric and magnetic fields, current density, Poynting vector</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid dynamics:</strong> Velocity field, vorticity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mastering vector operations is essential for understanding advanced physics.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Kinematics</h1>\n\n<h2>Introduction to Kinematics</h2>\n\n<p>Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that studies the motion of objects without referring to what causes the motion (forces). It provides the mathematical language to describe how objects move—their positions, velocities, and accelerations over time. Kinematics answers the questions \"where?\", \"how fast?\", and \"how is speed changing?\" but not \"why?\" (that's dynamics).</p>\n\n<p>Motion is a change in position in a time interval. Everything in the universe is in motion relative to something else—there is no absolute rest. When we describe motion, we must specify a reference frame.</p>\n\n<h2>Motion in One Dimension</h2>\n\n<p>One-dimensional motion is the simplest form of motion. A straight line motion could either be vertical (like that of a falling body), horizontal (a car on a straight road), or slanted, but it must be along a straight line. We can describe the entire motion using just one coordinate axis.</p>\n\n<h3>Position and Displacement</h3>\n\n<p>The position of an object in space is its location relative to some reference point, often the origin (or zero point). On a line, we typically use the x-coordinate. For example, a particle might be located at x = 5 m, which means the position of the particle is 5 m in the positive direction from the origin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Displacement</strong> is the change from one position x₁ to another position x₂. It is given as:</p>\n<p><strong>Δx = x₂ - x₁</strong></p>\n\n<p>Key distinctions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Displacement</strong> is a vector quantity—it has both magnitude and direction (positive or negative). It depends only on the starting and ending points, not on the path taken.</li>\n<li><strong>Distance</strong> is a scalar quantity—it is the total path length traveled. Distance is always positive and depends on the actual path.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person walks 3 m east, then 4 m west. The distance traveled = 3 + 4 = 7 m. The displacement = final position - initial position = -1 m (1 m west of start).</p>\n\n<p>Displacement can be positive, negative, or zero, while distance is always positive (or zero if no motion).</p>\n\n<h3>Average Velocity and Average Speed</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Average velocity</strong> is the ratio of the displacement Δx that occurs during a particular time interval Δt to that interval. It is a vector quantity:</p>\n<p><strong>v_avg = Δx/Δt = (x₂ - x₁)/(t₂ - t₁)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The SI unit of velocity is meters per second (m/s). Average velocity tells us the net effect of the motion—the constant velocity that would produce the same displacement in the same time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Average speed</strong> is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It is a scalar quantity:</p>\n<p><strong>speed_avg = total distance/total time</strong></p>\n\n<p>Average speed is always positive and is usually greater than or equal to the magnitude of average velocity (equal only if motion is in one direction without reversal).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A car travels 60 km east in 1 hour, then 60 km west in 1 hour. Displacement = 0, so average velocity = 0. Distance = 120 km, total time = 2 h, so average speed = 60 km/h.</p>\n\n<h3>Instantaneous Velocity and Speed</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Instantaneous velocity</strong> describes how fast a particle is moving at a given instant and in what direction. It is the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero:</p>\n<p><strong>v = lim_{Δt→0} Δx/Δt = dx/dt</strong></p>\n\n<p>The derivative dx/dt is the rate of change of position with respect to time. Graphically, it is the slope of the position-time graph at a point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity; that is, speed is velocity that has no indication of direction. For example, a velocity of +5 m/s or -5 m/s is associated with a speed of 5 m/s. Speed is always non-negative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The position of a particle moving on an x-axis is given by x = 7.8 + 9.2t - 2.1t³ with x in meters and t in seconds. What is its velocity at t = 3.5 s?</p>\n\n<p>v = dx/dt = 9.2 - 6.3t² (differentiating term by term)</p>\n<p>At t = 3.5 s, v = 9.2 - 6.3(3.5)² = 9.2 - 6.3(12.25) = 9.2 - 77.175 = -67.975 ≈ -68 m/s</p>\n\n<p>The negative sign indicates motion in the negative x-direction. Since the expression involves t, the velocity depends on time and is continuously changing—the particle is accelerating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The position of a particle is x = 4t² - 2t + 3. Find velocity at t = 2 s.</p>\n<p>v = dx/dt = 8t - 2. At t = 2 s, v = 8(2) - 2 = 14 m/s</p>\n\n<h3>Acceleration</h3>\n\n<p>When a particle's velocity changes (in magnitude, direction, or both), the particle is said to undergo acceleration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Average acceleration</strong> over a time interval Δt is:</p>\n<p><strong>a_avg = Δv/Δt = (v₂ - v₁)/(t₂ - t₁)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Instantaneous acceleration</strong> is the derivative of velocity with respect to time:</p>\n<p><strong>a = dv/dt = d²x/dt²</strong></p>\n\n<p>Acceleration is also a vector quantity. Positive acceleration means velocity is increasing in the positive direction; negative acceleration (deceleration) means velocity is decreasing or increasing in the negative direction.</p>\n\n<p>The SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A particle's position on the x-axis is given by x = 4 - 27t + t³. Find v(t) and a(t). Is there ever a time when v = 0?</p>\n\n<p>v = dx/dt = -27 + 3t²</p>\n<p>a = dv/dt = 6t</p>\n<p>Setting v = 0: -27 + 3t² = 0 ⇒ t² = 9 ⇒ t = 3 s (taking positive time)</p>\n<p>At t = 3 s, v = 0, a = 18 m/s² (positive, so particle will start moving in positive direction after this instant).</p>\n\n<h2>Motion with Constant Acceleration</h2>\n\n<p>In many types of motion, the acceleration is either constant or approximately so. Examples include free fall near Earth's surface (neglecting air resistance) and motion under constant force. For constant acceleration, we can derive a set of equations that relate displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.</p>\n\n<h3>Derivation of Kinematic Equations</h3>\n\n<p>Starting from a = constant:</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Velocity as function of time:</strong> Integrate a = dv/dt</p>\n<p>∫ dv = ∫ a dt ⇒ v - v₀ = at ⇒ <strong>v = v₀ + at</strong></p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Position as function of time:</strong> Since v = dx/dt, and v = v₀ + at</p>\n<p>dx/dt = v₀ + at ⇒ ∫ dx = ∫ (v₀ + at) dt</p>\n<p>x - x₀ = v₀t + ½at² ⇒ <strong>x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²</strong></p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Velocity as function of position:</strong> Using chain rule, a = dv/dt = (dv/dx)(dx/dt) = v dv/dx</p>\n<p>v dv = a dx ⇒ ∫ v dv = ∫ a dx</p>\n<p>½(v² - v₀²) = a(x - x₀) ⇒ <strong>v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀)</strong></p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Average velocity:</strong> For constant acceleration, average velocity is (v₀ + v)/2, so displacement also equals:</p>\n<p><strong>x - x₀ = ½(v₀ + v)t</strong></p>\n\n<p>These equations are summarized as:</p>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='5'>\n<tr><th>Equation</th><th>Description</th><th>Variables</th></tr>\n<tr><td>v = u + at</td><td>Velocity after time t</td><td>v, u, a, t</td></tr>\n<tr><td>s = ut + ½at²</td><td>Displacement after time t</td><td>s, u, t, a</td></tr>\n<tr><td>v² = u² + 2as</td><td>Relation between v, u, a, and s</td><td>v, u, a, s</td></tr>\n<tr><td>s = ½(u + v)t</td><td>Average velocity times time</td><td>s, u, v, t</td></tr>\n<tr><td>s = vt - ½at²</td><td>Alternative form</td><td>s, v, t, a</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Note: These equations are only applicable if acceleration is constant. In these equations, u represents initial velocity, v final velocity, a acceleration (constant), s displacement, and t time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A driver braked from a speed of 100 km/h to 80 km/h during a displacement of 88 m at constant acceleration.

        "content": "<h1>Work, Energy and Power</h1>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Energy is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics. It appears in many forms—mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, nuclear—and can be transformed from one form to another, but never created or destroyed. This chapter introduces the mechanical forms of energy: kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy), and the related concepts of work and power.</p>\n\n<h2>Kinetic Energy</h2>\n\n<p>The kinetic energy K is energy associated with the state of motion of a particle. The faster an object moves, the more kinetic energy it has. The kinetic energy of a particle is defined as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>K = ½ mv²</strong></p>\n\n<p>where m is the mass of the particle and v is the speed of the particle. Its SI unit is the joule (J), named after James Prescott Joule, who studied the nature of heat and energy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Consider a force F acting on a particle of mass m, accelerating it from rest to speed v. The work done by the force equals the kinetic energy gained. From work-energy theorem (which we'll prove shortly), this yields K = ½mv².</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A car of mass 1310 kg driven at a speed of 24.6 m/s has a kinetic energy of:</p>\n<p>K = ½ × 1310 × (24.6)² = 0.5 × 1310 × 605.16 = 0.5 × 792,759.6 = 396,379.8 J ≈ 4.0 × 10⁵ J</p>\n\n<p>This is about the energy released by exploding 100 grams of TNT.</p>\n\n<p>Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity—it has no direction. Two cars with the same speed but moving in opposite directions have the same kinetic energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Work</h2>\n\n<p>Work W is the energy transferred to or from an object by means of a force acting on the object. Energy transferred to the object is positive work, and energy transferred from the object is negative work. It is a scalar quantity.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of work in physics is more precise than everyday usage. In physics, if you hold a heavy object stationary, you're doing no work on it, even though you may feel tired. The tiredness comes from internal muscle contractions doing work inside your body, but not on the object.</p>\n\n<h3>Work Done by a Constant Force</h3>\n\n<p>The work done by a constant force can be defined as the product of the magnitude of the displacement and the component of the force in the direction of the displacement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>W = Fx cos φ</strong> or <strong>W = F·x</strong></p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>F is the magnitude of the force</li>\n<li>x is the magnitude of the displacement</li>\n<li>φ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Interpretation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If φ = 0° (force in direction of motion), W = Fx (maximum positive work)</li>\n<li>If φ = 90° (force perpendicular to motion), W = 0 (no work)</li>\n<li>If φ = 180° (force opposite to motion), W = -Fx (negative work)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A person pushes a box with a force of 50 N at an angle of 30° below horizontal, moving it 10 m horizontally. Find the work done.</p>\n<p>W = Fd cos θ = 50 × 10 × cos 30° = 500 × 0.866 = 433 J</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A crate slides across an oily parking lot through a displacement d = (-3 m)î while a steady wind pushes against the crate with a force F = (2 N)î + (-6 N)ĵ. Calculate the work done by the wind.</p>\n<p>W = F·d = (2î - 6ĵ)·(-3î) = (2)(-3) + (-6)(0) = -6 J</p>\n<p>The negative work means the wind is removing energy from the crate.</p>\n\n<h3>Work Done by a Variable Force</h3>\n\n<p>For a variable force, the work done in moving a particle from initial point i to final point f is the integral of force dot displacement along the path:</p>\n\n<p><strong>W = ∫ᵢᶠ F·dr = ∫ᵢᶠ F dr cos θ</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the force varies with position, we must integrate. Graphically, for one-dimensional motion, work is the area under the F(x) vs. x curve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A spring force F = -kx (Hooke's law) does work when stretched. To stretch a spring from x=0 to x=X, the work done is:</p>\n<p>W = ∫₀ˣ F dx = ∫₀ˣ kx dx = ½kX²</p>\n<p>The force applied by an external agent is opposite to the spring force, so the external work is +½kX².</p>\n\n<h2>Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem</h2>\n\n<p>The work-kinetic energy theorem is one of the most important results in mechanics. It states that when a body is acted upon by a force or resultant force, the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proof for one-dimensional motion with variable force:</strong></p>\n\n<p>W = ∫ᵢᶠ F·dr = ∫ᵢᶠ F dx (for motion along x-axis)</p>\n<p>But F = ma = m dv/dt = m (dv/dx)(dx/dt) = m v dv/dx</p>\n<p>Therefore, F dx = m v dv</p>\n<p>W = ∫ᵢᶠ m v dv = m[v²/2]ᵢᶠ = ½mv_f² - ½mv_i²</p>\n<p><strong>W = ΔK = K_f - K_i</strong></p>\n\n<p>The theorem holds for any force, conservative or non-conservative, and extends to multiple dimensions using vector calculus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> If the crate in Example 2 has a kinetic energy of 10 J at the beginning of the displacement d, what is the kinetic energy at the end?</p>\n\n<p>W = ΔK = K_f - K_i</p>\n<p>K_f = W + K_i = -6 + 10 = 4 J</p>\n\n<p>The crate's kinetic energy decreased because the wind did negative work on it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> A 2 kg object moving at 5 m/s is acted upon by a force that does 30 J of work. Find its final velocity.</p>\n<p>Initial K_i = ½(2)(5)² = 25 J</p>\n<p>W = ΔK ⇒ 30 = K_f - 25 ⇒ K_f = 55 J</p>\n<p>½(2)v_f² = 55 ⇒ v_f² = 55 ⇒ v_f = 7.42 m/s</p>\n\n<h2>Potential Energy</h2>\n\n<p>Potential energy U is the energy that can be associated with the configuration (or arrangement) of a system of objects that exert forces on one another. It is stored energy that has the potential to do work.</p>\n\n<p>Potential energy exists only for conservative forces—forces for which the work done is independent of path and depends only on initial and final positions. Examples: gravity, spring force, electric force.</p>\n\n<h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>\n\n<p>For a system of Earth and a particle, the change in gravitational potential energy is defined as the negative of the work done by the gravitational force:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ΔU = -W = -∫ F·dr</strong></p>\n\n<p>For a constant gravitational force near Earth's surface, F = -mg ĵ (taking upward as positive). Moving from y_i to y_f:</p>\n\n<p>W = ∫ F·dr = ∫ (-mg ĵ)·(dy ĵ) = -mg ∫ dy = -mg(y_f - y_i)</p>\n<p>Therefore, ΔU = -W = mg(y_f - y_i)</p>\n\n<p><strong>ΔU = mg(y_f - y_i)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Taking U_i = 0 at y_i = 0 (reference level), the gravitational potential energy at height y is:</p>\n<p><strong>U(y) = mgy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: Only changes in potential energy are physically meaningful. The reference level can be chosen arbitrarily.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 5 kg book is lifted from floor to shelf 2 m high. Change in potential energy = mgh = 5 × 9.8 × 2 = 98 J. This is the work done against gravity.</p>\n\n<h3>Elastic Potential Energy</h3>\n\n<p>Elastic potential energy is the energy associated with the state of compression or extension of an elastic object. For a spring that exerts a force F = -kx when its free end is displaced by x from equilibrium (Hooke's law), the work done by the spring force when moving from x=0 to x=X is:</p>\n\n<p>W_s = ∫₀ˣ (-kx) dx = -½kX²</p>\n\n<p>The change in potential energy is ΔU = -W_s = ½kX². Taking U=0 at equilibrium (x=0), the elastic potential energy is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>U = ½kx²</strong></p>\n\n<p>where k is the spring constant (stiffness) in N/m, and x is the displacement from equilibrium.</p>\n\n<h2>Conservation of Mechanical Energy</h2>\n\n<p>For a system where only conservative forces do work, mechanical energy is conserved. This is a powerful principle for solving problems without dealing with forces directly.</p>\n\n<p>From the work-kinetic energy theorem: W = ΔK</p>\n<p>For conservative forces: W = -ΔU</p>\n<p>Combining: ΔK = -ΔU</p>\n<p><strong>K₂ + U₂ = K₁ + U₁</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the conservation of mechanical energy equation. The total mechanical energy E_mec = K + U remains constant.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that: In an isolated system where only conservative forces act, the kinetic energy and potential energy can change, but their sum, the mechanical energy of the system, cannot change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ΔE_mec = ΔK + ΔU = 0</strong></p>\n\n<p>If non-conservative forces (like friction) are present, then ΔE_mec = W_nc, where W_nc is the work done by non-conservative forces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 5: Simple Pendulum</strong></p>\n<p>A pendulum bob of mass 2 kg is released from rest when the string makes an angle of 60° with the vertical.

        "content": "<h1>Rotational Dynamics of Rigid Bodies</h1>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>So far, we've studied translational motion—objects moving from place to place. But objects can also rotate—spin around an axis. A wheel rotates, Earth spins on its axis, a spinning top whirls. Rotational motion requires its own set of concepts and equations, which parallel those of translational motion. Understanding rotation is essential for analyzing everything from bicycle wheels to galaxies.</p>\n\n<h2>Rigid Body</h2>\n\n<p>A rigid body is a body that can rotate with all its parts locked together and without a change in its shape. This is an idealization—real objects deform slightly—but it's an excellent approximation for many situations. In a rigid body, the distance between any two points remains constant during motion.</p>\n\n<p>Examples: a solid disk, a wheel, a rod, a sphere (if not deforming).</p>\n\n<h2>Rotation</h2>\n\n<p>Rotation occurs when every point of a rigid body moves in a circle whose center lies on the axis of rotation, and every point moves through the same angle during a particular time interval. The axis of rotation can be internal (like Earth's axis) or external (like a ball on a string).</p>\n\n<p>Key point: In pure rotation, all points have the same angular velocity but different linear velocities depending on their distance from the axis.</p>\n\n<h2>Angular Variables</h2>\n\n<p>Just as we used position, velocity, and acceleration for linear motion, we define analogous quantities for rotational motion.</p>\n\n<h3>Angular Position (θ)</h3>\n\n<p>Angular position θ is the angle of a reference line relative to a fixed direction, say the positive x-axis. It is measured in radians (rad), not degrees, because radians simplify the relationships between angular and linear quantities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>θ = s/r</strong> (radians)</p>\n\n<p>where s is the length of arc along a circle of radius r. One complete revolution corresponds to θ = 2π rad (since circumference = 2πr).</p>\n\n<p>Conversion: 1 revolution = 360° = 2π rad ⇒ 1 rad = 180°/π ≈ 57.3°</p>\n\n<h3>Angular Displacement</h3>\n\n<p>A body undergoes angular displacement if it changes angular position from θ₁ to θ₂:</p>\n<p><strong>Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angular displacement is a vector quantity in three dimensions, with direction along the axis of rotation (right-hand rule). For rotation in a plane, we can treat it as positive (counterclockwise) or negative (clockwise).</p>\n\n<h3>Angular Velocity</h3>\n\n<p>The average angular speed ω_avg is the ratio of the angular displacement Δθ to the time interval Δt:</p>\n<p><strong>ω_avg = Δθ/Δt</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instantaneous angular velocity ω of the body is:</p>\n<p><strong>ω = lim_{Δt→0} Δθ/Δt = dθ/dt</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angular velocity is a vector (ω) pointing along the axis of rotation, with direction given by the right-hand rule: curl fingers in direction of rotation, thumb points in direction of ω.</p>\n\n<p>The SI unit of angular velocity is radian per second (rad/s).</p>\n\n<h3>Angular Acceleration</h3>\n\n<p>When angular velocity changes, the body has angular acceleration. The average angular acceleration α_avg is:</p>\n<p><strong>α_avg = Δω/Δt</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instantaneous angular acceleration α of a body is:</p>\n<p><strong>α = lim_{Δt→0} Δω/Δt = dω/dt = d²θ/dt²</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angular acceleration is also a vector, parallel to the axis of rotation (in the direction of change of ω).</p>\n\n<p>SI unit: rad/s².</p>\n\n<h3>Rotational Kinematics for Constant Angular Acceleration</h3>\n\n<p>For constant angular acceleration, we have equations analogous to linear motion with constant acceleration:</p>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='5'>\n<tr><th>Linear Equation</th><th>Rotational Equation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>v = u + at</td><td>ω = ω₀ + αt</td></tr>\n<tr><td>s = ut + ½at²</td><td>θ = ω₀t + ½αt²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>v² = u² + 2as</td><td>ω² = ω₀² + 2αθ</td></tr>\n<tr><td>s = ½(u + v)t</td><td>θ = ½(ω₀ + ω)t</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A wheel rotating at 10 rad/s accelerates uniformly to 30 rad/s in 5 s. Find angular acceleration and number of revolutions during this time.</p>\n<p>α = (ω - ω₀)/t = (30 - 10)/5 = 4 rad/s²</p>\n<p>θ = ω₀t + ½αt² = 10(5) + ½(4)(25) = 50 + 50 = 100 rad</p>\n<p>Number of revolutions = θ/(2π) = 100/6.28 = 15.9 rev</p>\n\n<h2>Relating Angular and Linear Variables</h2>\n\n<p>Since for a rigid body, all particles make one revolution in the same amount of time, they all have the same angular velocity. However, points at different distances from the axis have different linear speeds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Linear speed:</strong> v = ωr</p>\n<p>This follows from s = rθ, differentiating with respect to time: ds/dt = r dθ/dt ⇒ v = ωr.</p>\n\n<p>A rigid body in rotational motion will have two forms of acceleration for any point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tangential acceleration:</strong> a_t = αr — due to change in angular velocity (change in speed along the circle).</li>\n<li><strong>Centripetal (radial) acceleration:</strong> a_c = v²/r = ω²r — due to change in direction of velocity, always pointing toward the center.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The total linear acceleration is the vector sum: a = √(a_t² + a_c²).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A point on a disk 0.3 m from the center has ω = 20 rad/s and α = 5 rad/s². Find its linear speed, tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration, and total acceleration.</p>\n<p>v = ωr = 20 × 0.3 = 6 m/s</p>\n<p>a_t = αr = 5 × 0.3 = 1.5 m/s²</p>\n<p>a_c = ω²r = 400 × 0.3 = 120 m/s²</p>\n<p>a_total = √(1.5² + 120²) ≈ 120.01 m/s² (almost entirely centripetal)</p>\n\n<h2>Kinetic Energy of Rotation</h2>\n\n<p>We cannot apply the formula K = ½mv² directly to a rigid body because different parts have different speeds. Instead, we treat the rigid body as a collection of particles with different speeds.</p>\n\n<p>K = Σ ½ m_i v_i²</p>\n<p>Since v_i = ω r_i (all particles have same ω but different r_i):</p>\n<p>K = Σ ½ m_i (ω r_i)² = ½ (Σ m_i r_i²) ω²</p>\n\n<p>The quantity in parentheses is called the <strong>rotational inertia</strong> or <strong>moment of inertia I</strong> of the body with respect to the axis of rotation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>K = ½ I ω²</strong></p>\n\n<p>where <strong>I = Σ m_i r_i²</strong> for a system of discrete masses, or <strong>I = ∫ r² dm</strong> for a continuous body.</p>\n\n<p>Moment of inertia is the rotational analog of mass. While mass measures resistance to linear acceleration, moment of inertia measures resistance to angular acceleration. However, unlike mass, I depends not only on how much mass there is, but also on how it is distributed relative to the axis of rotation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Two wheels of same mass, one a solid disk, one a ring, both of same radius. Which has greater I? The ring has all mass at distance R, so I_ring = MR². The disk has mass distributed from 0 to R, so I_disk = ½MR². The ring has greater rotational inertia and is harder to start spinning.</p>\n\n<h2>Moment of Inertia for Common Shapes</h2>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='5'>\n<tr><th>Object</th><th>Axis</th><th>Moment of Inertia</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Point mass</td><td>At distance r</td><td>I = mr²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thin ring/hoop</td><td>Through center, perpendicular to plane</td><td>I = MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thin ring/hoop</td><td>Diameter</td><td>I = ½MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Solid disk/cylinder</td><td>Through center, perpendicular to plane</td><td>I = ½MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Solid cylinder</td><td>Longitudinal axis</td><td>I = ½MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Solid sphere</td><td>Through center</td><td>I = ⅖MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Spherical shell</td><td>Through center</td><td>I = ⅔MR²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thin rod</td><td>Through center, perpendicular to length</td><td>I = (1/12)ML²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thin rod</td><td>Through end, perpendicular to length</td><td>I = (1/3)ML²</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rectangular plate</td><td>Through center, perpendicular to plane</td><td>I = (1/12)M(a² + b²)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculate I for a solid sphere of mass 5 kg and radius 0.2 m about its center.</p>\n<p>I = ⅖MR² = 0.4 × 5 × (0.2)² = 0.4 × 5 × 0.04 = 0.08 kg·m²</p>\n\n<h2>Perpendicular Axes Theorem</h2>\n\n<p>The perpendicular axes theorem applies to plane laminae (thin, flat objects). It states:</p>\n\n<p><strong>I_z = I_x + I_y</strong></p>\n\n<p>where I_z is the moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the lamina, and I_x and I_y are moments of inertia about two mutually perpendicular axes in the plane of the lamina, all passing through the same point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For a particle of mass m_i at position (x_i, y_i), its distance from the z-axis is R_i = √(x_i² + y_i²). The moment of inertia about the z-axis is:</p>\n<p>I_z = Σ m_i R_i² = Σ m_i (x_i² + y_i²) = Σ m_i x_i² + Σ m_i y_i² = I_x + I_y</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> For a thin rectangular plate of sides a and b, I_x about axis along side a is (1/12)Mb², I_y about axis along side b is (1/12)Ma². Then I_z (about perpendicular through center) = (1/12)M(a² + b²).</p>\n\n<h2>Parallel Axis Theorem</h2>\n\n<p>The parallel axis theorem allows us to find the moment of inertia about any axis parallel to an axis through the center of mass. It states:</p>\n\n<p><strong>I = I_cm + Mh²</strong></p>\n\n<p>where I_cm is the moment of inertia about an axis through the center of mass, M is the total mass, and h is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Consider a body with center of mass at origin. For an axis parallel to the z-axis through point (h,0), the distance squared for a mass element dm at (x,y) is (x-h)² + y² = x² + y² + h² - 2xh. Integrating gives I = I_cm + Mh² - 2h∫x dm. The last term is zero because ∫x dm = M x_cm = 0 (since x_cm = 0).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find I of a thin rod of length L about an axis through one end perpendicular to the rod.</p>\n<p>I_cm = (1/12)ML², h = L/2</p>\n<p>I = (1/12)ML² + M(L/2)² = (1/12 + 1/4)ML² = (1/12 + 3/12)ML² = (4/12)ML² = (1/3)ML²</p>\n\n<h2>Torque</h2>\n\n<p>Torque (τ) is the rotational analog of force. It measures the tendency of a force to cause rotation about an axis. A force can cause translation, but if it acts off-center, it also causes rotation.</p>\n\n<p>For a force F applied at position r relative to the axis:</p>\n<p><strong>τ = r × F</strong> (vector cross product)</p>\n<p><strong>Magnitude: τ = rF sin θ</strong>, where θ is the angle between r and F.</p>\n\n<p>The direction of τ is along the axis of rotation, given by right-hand rule.</p>\n\n<p>Interpretation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum torque when force is perpendicular to r (θ = 90°)</li>\n<li>Zero torque when force is parallel to r (θ = 0° or 180°) or when r = 0 (force through axis)</li>\n<li>Torque depends on both force magnitude and lever arm (perpendicular distance from axis to line of force)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The unit of torque is Newton-meter (N·m), same as work, but torque is a vector and work is scalar—they are different quantities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A force of 50 N is applied at 30° to a wrench handle of length 0.4 m. Find torque.</p>\n<p>τ = rF sin θ = 0.4 × 50 × sin 30° = 0.4 × 50 × 0.5 = 10 N·m</p>\n\n<h2>Rotational Dynamics</h2>\n\n<p>The rotational analog of Newton's second law (F = ma) is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>τ_net = I α</strong></p>\n\n<p>where τ_net is the net torque about the axis, I is the moment of inertia about that axis, and α is the angular acceleration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Derivation for a particle:</strong> For a single particle of mass m at distance r from axis, acted on by force F (perpendicular component F_t), torque τ = rF_t. Since F_t = ma_t = m(rα), τ = m r² α. Summing over all particles, τ_net = (Σ m_i r_i²) α = I α.</p>\n\n<p>This equation holds when the axis is fixed and I is constant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A disk (M = 2 kg, R = 0.3 m) has a string wrapped around its rim pulled with force 5 N. Find angular acceleration.</p>\n<p>I = ½MR² = 0.5 × 2 × 0.09 = 0.09 kg·m²</p>\n<p>Torque = F × R = 5 × 0.3 = 1.5 N·m</p>\n<p>α = τ/I = 1.5/0.09 = 16.7 rad/s²</p>\n\n<h2>Angular Momentum</h2>\n\n<p>Angular momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum. For a particle, the angular momentum L about a point is:</p>\n<p><strong>L = r × p</strong> (vector cross product)</p>\n<p><strong>Magnitude: L = mvr sin θ</strong> = r p_perpendicular</p>\n\n<p>For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, the angular momentum is:</p>\n<p><strong>L = I ω</strong> (in vector form, L = I ω along the axis)</p>\n\n<p>This is analogous to p = mv for linear motion.</p>\n\n<p>SI unit of angular momentum: kg·m²/s.</p>\n\n<p>Newton's second law in angular form: τ_net = dL/dt (just as F_net = dp/dt). For constant I, this reduces to τ_net = I α.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A disk with I = 0.05 kg·m² rotates at 20 rad/s. Find its angular momentum.</p>\n<p>L = Iω = 0.05 × 20 = 1 kg·m²/s</p>\n\n<h2>Conservation of Angular Momentum</h2>\n\n<p>The principle of conservation of angular momentum states:</p>\n\n<p><strong>When the net external torque acting on a system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system remains constant.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>L_i = L_f</strong> or <strong>I_i ω_i = I_f ω_f</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a fundamental conservation law, as important as conservation of energy and conservation of linear momentum.</p>\n\n<p>This explains many everyday phenomena:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A spinning ice skater spins faster when pulling arms in (decreasing I, increasing ω to keep L constant)</li>\n<li>A diver tucks to spin faster in the air, then extends to slow rotation before entering water</li>\n<li>A spinning bicycle wheel can be used to change orientation of a rotating platform</li>\n<li>Neutron stars spin incredibly fast because they collapse from much larger stars, conserving angular momentum</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A skater with arms extended has I₁ = 4 kg·m² and spins at ω₁ = 2 rad/s. She pulls arms in, reducing I₂ = 1.6 kg·m². Find new angular speed.</p>\n<p>Conservation: I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ ⇒ ω₂ = (I₁/I₂)ω₁ = (4/1.6) × 2 = 2.5 × 2 = 5 rad/s</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A rotating platform (I = 500 kg·m²) rotates at 0.5 rad/s. A person (m = 60 kg) walks from edge to center. Radius initially 2 m, finally 0 m. Find new angular speed.</p>\n<p>Initial I_total = I_platform + mR² = 500 + 60(4) = 500 + 240 = 740 kg·m²</p>\n<p>Final I_total = I_platform + 0 = 500 kg·m²</p>\n<p>Conservation: 740 × 0.5 = 500 × ω_f ⇒ ω_f = 370/500 = 0.74 rad/s</p>\n\n<h2>Work and Power in Rotation</h2>\n\n<p>Work done by a torque rotating an object through an angular displacement Δθ is:</p>\n<p><strong>W = τ Δθ</strong> (for constant torque)</p>\n<p>For variable torque: W = ∫ τ dθ</p>\n\n<p>Power in rotational motion:</p>\n<p><strong>P = τ ω</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is analogous to P = Fv for linear motion.</p>\n\n<p>Rotational kinetic energy: K = ½Iω²</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A motor delivers constant torque of 20 N·m to a wheel rotating at 10 rad/s. Find power and work done in 5 s.</p>\n<p>P = τω = 20 × 10 = 200 W</p>\n<p>Work = P × t = 200 × 5 = 1000 J</p>\n<p>Alternatively, angular displacement θ = ωt = 10 × 5 = 50 rad, so W = τθ = 20 × 50 = 1000 J</p>\n\n<h2>Rolling Motion</h2>\n\n<p>When a wheel rolls without slipping, it has both translational and rotational motion. The condition for rolling without slipping is:</p>\n<p><strong>v_cm = ωR</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total kinetic energy is the sum of translational KE of center of mass and rotational KE about center of mass:</p>\n<p><strong>K_total = ½Mv_cm² + ½I_cm ω²</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since ω = v_cm/R for rolling without slipping, K_total = ½Mv_cm² + ½I_cm (v_cm²/R²) = ½ (M + I_cm/R²) v_cm²</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A solid sphere (I = ⅖MR²) rolls without slipping. What fraction of its total KE is rotational?</p>\n<p>K_rot = ½(⅖MR²)(v²/R²) = ⅕Mv²</p>\n<p>K_trans = ½Mv²</p>\n<p>K_total = ½Mv² + ⅕Mv² = 0.5Mv² + 0.2Mv² = 0.7Mv²</p>\n<p>Fraction rotational = 0.2/0.7 = 2/7 ≈ 28.6%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comparison of rolling objects down an incline:</strong> Objects with smaller rotational inertia (more mass concentrated near center) accelerate faster because less energy goes into rotation. Order from fastest to slowest: hollow sphere (⅔) slower than solid sphere (⅖), which is slower than disk (½), which is slower than ring (1).</p>"

It's the force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun, holds moons around planets, binds galaxies together, and governs the fall of an apple from a tree. Before Isaac Newton, these were seen as separate phenomena—celestial motions were thought to follow different rules than earthly motions. Newton's great insight was to recognize that the same force governs both.</p>\n\n<p>Newton proposed a force law that we call Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, published in his Principia Mathematica in 1687. This law unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics and laid the foundation for modern physics.</p>\n\n<h2>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>\n\n<p>The law states that: Every particle attracts any other particle with a gravitational force whose magnitude is given by:</p>\n\n<p><strong>F = G m₁m₂/r²</strong></p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two particles (kg)</li>\n<li>r is the distance between their centers (m)</li>\n<li>G is the gravitational constant, a fundamental constant of nature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²</strong></p>\n\n<p>Key features of the gravitational force:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The force is always attractive—it pulls masses together (unlike electric forces which can repel)</li>\n<li>The force acts along the line joining the two particles</li>\n<li>The force is mutual and equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (Newton's third law)</li>\n<li>The force obeys an inverse-square law—doubling distance reduces force to 1/4</li>\n<li>The force is extremely weak compared to electric forces—G is very small</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The small value of G explains why we don't feel gravitational attraction from nearby objects—only massive bodies like Earth produce noticeable forces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Two 1 kg masses 1 m apart attract each other with force:</p>\n<p>F = 6.67×10⁻¹¹ × 1 × 1 / 1² = 6.67×10⁻¹¹ N — about the weight of a bacterium!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Earth (mass 5.98×10²⁴ kg) and Moon (mass 7.36×10²² kg) are 3.84×10⁸ m apart.

Find the net gravitational force on particle 1.</p>\n\n<p>First, convert distances to meters: r₁₂ = 0.02 m, r₁₃ = 0.04 m</p>\n\n<p>F₁₂ = G(6)(4)/(0.02)² = 24G/0.0004 = 60,000 G = 60,000 × 6.67×10⁻¹¹ = 4.00×10⁻⁶ N (in +x direction)</p>\n\n<p>F₁₃ = G(6)(4)/(0.04)² = 24G/0.0016 = 15,000 G = 15,000 × 6.67×10⁻¹¹ = 1.00×10⁻⁶ N (in +y direction)</p>\n\n<p>F₁,net = √[(4.00×10⁻⁶)² + (1.00×10⁻⁶)²] = √(16×10⁻¹² + 1×10⁻¹²) = √(17×10⁻¹²) = 4.12×10⁻⁶ N</p>\n\n<p>Direction: θ = tan⁻¹(1.00×10⁻⁶/4.00×10⁻⁶) = tan⁻¹(0.25) = 14° from x-axis</p>\n\n<h2>Gravitational Field</h2>\n\n<p>The gravitational field strength g at a point is the gravitational force per unit mass experienced by a test mass placed at that point:</p>\n\n<p><strong>g = F/m = GM/r²</strong></p>\n\n<p>The gravitational field is a vector pointing toward the mass M that creates it. Near Earth's surface, g ≈ 9.8 m/s² directed toward Earth's center.</p>\n\n<p>The field concept is powerful because it separates the source (mass M) from the test object—the field exists whether or not we place a test mass there.</p>\n\n<p>For a continuous mass distribution, the field is found by integrating contributions from all mass elements: g = ∫ (G dm/r²) r̂</p>\n\n<h2>Acceleration Due to Gravity</h2>\n\n<p>The acceleration due to gravity g varies from location to location. The standard value 9.8 m/s² is an average. Actual variations occur due to:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Latitude (Earth's Rotation and Shape)</h3>\n\n<p>g is greater at the poles than at the equator for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earth is oblate (bulging at equator)—polar radius is about 21 km less than equatorial radius, so r is smaller at poles, increasing g (g ∝ 1/r²).</li>\n<li>Centrifugal effect due to Earth's rotation reduces apparent g at equator (objects need some acceleration to stay in circular motion).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Result: g_pole ≈ 9.83 m/s², g_equator ≈ 9.78 m/s².</p>\n\n<h3>2. Altitude (Height Above Surface)</h3>\n\n<p>At height h above Earth's surface, distance from Earth's center is R + h, so:</p>\n<p><strong>g_h = GM/(R + h)² = g₀/(1 + h/R)²</strong></p>\n\n<p>For small h (h << R), using binomial approximation: g_h ≈ g₀(1 - 2h/R)</p>\n\n<p>So g decreases by about 0.31% per km of altitude near surface.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> At height 10 km, g = 9.8(1 - 2×10/6370) = 9.8(1 - 0.00314) = 9.77 m/s²</p>\n\n<h3>3. Depth Below Earth's Surface</h3>\n\n<p>Inside Earth, assuming uniform density, only the mass inside the radius r contributes to gravity. Mass inside = M(r³/R³). So:</p>\n<p><strong>g_d = G M(r³/R³)/r² = (GM/R²)(r/R) = g₀(r/R)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thus g decreases linearly with depth, reaching zero at Earth's center.</p>\n\n<p>At depth d (r = R - d): g_d = g₀(1 - d/R)</p>\n\n<h2>Gravitational Potential Energy</h2>\n\n<p>For two point masses separated by distance r, the gravitational potential energy is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>U = -G m₁m₂/r</strong></p>\n\n<p>The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive and that the potential energy is zero at infinite separation (by convention). As masses come together, U becomes more negative, decreasing potential energy and increasing kinetic energy if they fall toward each other.</p>\n\n<p>Key properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U is always negative for finite separations</li>\n<li>U becomes more negative as r decreases</li>\n<li>The force F = -dU/dr (for radial direction), giving F = -Gm₁m₂/r² (negative means attractive)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a mass m at distance r from Earth's center, U = -GMm/r. Near Earth's surface, this reduces to mgh (approximately) when we set reference at surface, but careful: mgh is valid only for small height changes where g is approximately constant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 1000 kg satellite at altitude 300 km (r = 6.67×10⁶ m) has potential energy U = -GMm/r = - (6.67×10⁻¹¹ × 5.98×10²⁴ × 1000)/(6.67×10⁶) = -5.98×10¹⁰ J</p>\n\n<h2>Escape Velocity</h2>\n\n<p>The escape velocity is the minimum velocity needed by an object to be projected from the surface of a celestial body to overcome the gravitational pull completely, reaching infinity with zero kinetic energy.</p>\n\n<p>From energy conservation at surface and at infinity (U∞ = 0, K∞ = 0):</p>\n<p>½mv_esc² - GMm/R = 0</p>\n<p><strong>v_esc = √(2GM/R) = √(2gR)</strong></p>\n\n<p>For Earth:</p>\n<p>v_esc = √(2 × 6.67×10⁻¹¹ × 5.98×10²⁴ / 6.37×10⁶) = √(1.253×10⁸) = 1.12×10⁴ m/s = 11.2 km/s</p>\n\n<p>Escape velocities for other bodies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moon: 2.4 km/s</li>\n<li>Mars: 5.0 km/s</li>\n<li>Jupiter: 59.5 km/s</li>\n<li>Sun: 618 km/s</li>\n<li>Black hole: v_esc > c (speed of light), so nothing escapes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> What velocity is needed to escape the solar system from Earth's orbit?</p>\n<p>Need to escape Sun's gravity: v_esc,sun = √(2GM_sun/r_earth) = √(2 × 6.67×10⁻¹¹ × 1.99×10³⁰ / 1.5×10¹¹) = 42.1 km/s relative to Sun.</p>\n<p>But Earth is already moving at 29.8 km/s around Sun, so additional velocity needed depends on direction of launch.</p>\n\n<h2>Satellite Motion</h2>\n\n<p>The gravitational force on a satellite provides the centripetal acceleration that keeps it in circular orbit:</p>\n\n<p>GMm/r² = mv²/r</p>\n\n<p>Solving for orbital velocity:</p>\n<p><strong>v = √(GM/r)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: Orbital velocity is independent of satellite mass (Galileo's insight—all objects fall at same rate). It decreases as r increases (higher orbits are slower).</p>\n\n<p>For a satellite close to Earth's surface (r ≈ R): v ≈ √(gR) = √(9.8 × 6.37×10⁶) = 7.9 km/s. This is about 28,000 km/h.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Period of revolution:</strong> T = 2πr/v = 2πr / √(GM/r) = 2π√(r³/GM)</p>\n\n<p>This is Kepler's third law: T² ∝ r³.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Geostationary satellite (T = 24 h = 86,400 s). Find its orbital radius.</p>\n<p>T² = 4π²r³/GM ⇒ r³ = (T²GM)/(4π²)</p>\n<p>r³ = (86,400² × 6.67×10⁻¹¹ × 5.98×10²⁴)/(4π²)</p>\n<p>= (7.46×10⁹ × 3.99×10¹⁴)/39.5 = 7.53×10²² m³</p>\n<p>r = 4.22×10⁷ m = 42,200 km from Earth's center</p>\n<p>Altitude = r - R = 42,200 - 6,370 = 35,830 km</p>\n\n<h2>Parking Orbit</h2>\n\n<p>A parking orbit is a satellite orbit whose period of revolution equals the period of rotation of Earth about its axis (24 hours). Such satellites appear stationary relative to Earth's surface and are called geostationary or geosynchronous satellites.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements for geostationary orbit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orbit must be in equatorial plane</li>\n<li>Orbit must be circular</li>\n<li>Altitude must be about 36,000 km above surface</li>\n<li>Direction of revolution must match Earth's rotation (west to east)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Applications: communication satellites (satellite TV, phone), weather satellites (continuous view of same region), some navigation systems.</p>\n\n<p>At this altitude, the satellite's orbital velocity is about 3.07 km/s.</p>\n\n<h2>Weightlessness</h2>\n\n<p>When there is no reaction force to an object's weight, the object becomes weightless. This occurs in free fall, such as in orbiting spacecraft, where both the spacecraft and objects inside are in continuous free fall toward Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Important clarification: Weightlessness does NOT mean zero gravity. Gravity is still present—it provides the centripetal force that keeps the spacecraft in orbit. At typical orbital altitudes (300 km), gravity is about 90% of surface value. Astronauts feel weightless not because gravity is absent, but because they are falling freely along with their spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>The sensation of weight comes from the reaction force of the ground pushing up on us. In free fall, no such force exists, so we feel weightless.</p>\n\n<h2>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</h2>\n\n<p>Johannes Kepler, using meticulous observations by Tycho Brahe, derived three empirical laws of planetary motion. Newton later showed these laws follow from his law of gravitation and laws of motion.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Law of Orbits:</strong> All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.</li>\n\n<p>Ellipses are characterized by eccentricity e (0 for circle, between 0 and 1 for ellipse). Earth's orbit has e ≈ 0.017 (nearly circular). Mercury has e ≈ 0.205 (most eccentric among planets).</p>\n\n<li><strong>Law of Areas:</strong> A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.</li>\n\n<p>This is equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. Planets move faster when closer to Sun (perihelion) and slower when farther (aphelion).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Earth's orbital speed at perihelion (January) is about 30.3 km/s; at aphelion (July) about 29.3 km/s.</p>\n\n<li><strong>Law of Periods:</strong> The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</li>\n\n<p><strong>T² ∝ a³</strong> or <strong>T² = (4π²/GM) a³</strong></p>\n\n<p>where a is the semi-major axis (average distance from Sun). For circular orbits, a = r.</p>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Mars has orbital period 687 Earth days. Find its average distance from Sun.</p>\n<p>For Earth: T_E² ∝ r_E³ ⇒ T_E²/r_E³ = constant</p>\n<p>For Mars: T_M²/r_M³ = same constant ⇒ r_M³ = r_E³ × (T_M/T_E)²</p>\n<p>r_E = 1 AU (astronomical unit ≈ 1.5×10¹¹ m), T_E = 365 days, T_M = 687 days</p>\n<p>r_M³ = 1³ × (687/365)² = (1.882)² = 3.54</p>\n<p>r_M = ∛3.54 = 1.52 AU</p>\n\n<h2>Derivation of Kepler's Third Law from Newton's Law</h2>\n\n<p>For a planet of mass m orbiting Sun of mass M in a circular orbit of radius r:</p>\n\n<p>Gravitational force provides centripetal force: GMm/r² = mv²/r</p>\n<p>v² = GM/r</p>\n<p>But v = 2πr/T, so (2πr/T)² = GM/r</p>\n<p>4π²r²/T² = GM/r</p>\n<p>T² = (4π²/GM) r³</p>\n\n<p>This shows T² ∝ r³, with constant of proportionality depending only on Sun's mass.</p>"
