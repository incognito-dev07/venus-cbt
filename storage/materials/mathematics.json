        "content": "<h1>Set Theory </h1>\n\n<h2>Introduction to Sets</h2>\n<p>A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. This concept, introduced by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century, forms the foundation upon which nearly all of modern mathematics is built. The objects in a set are called elements or members of the set. The term \"well-defined\" is crucial—it means that for any given object, we must be able to determine unequivocally whether that object belongs to the set or not.</p>\n\n<h3>Notation and Symbolism</h3>\n<p>Sets are usually denoted by capital letters (A, B, C, ...) and elements by lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...). This convention helps distinguish between collections and their individual members. If an element x belongs to a set A, we write x ∈ A (read as \"x is an element of A\" or \"x belongs to A\"). If x does not belong to A, we write x ∉ A (read as \"x is not an element of A\").</p>\n\n<p>For example, if A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then we can say 3 ∈ A, but 7 ∉ A. This notation provides a precise way to discuss membership relationships.</p>\n\n<h3>Methods of Describing Sets</h3>\n<p>There are two primary ways to describe a set, each with its own advantages depending on the nature of the set:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Roster Method (Tabular Form):</strong> This method involves listing all elements within curly braces, separated by commas. It is most useful for sets with a finite number of elements or for sets where the pattern of elements is immediately obvious.</p>\n<p>Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} — a finite set of the first five natural numbers.</p>\n<p>Example: B = {a, e, i, o, u} — the set of vowels in the English alphabet.</p>\n<p>Example: C = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...} — the set of even positive integers (the pattern is clear, so we can use ellipsis).</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Set Builder Method (Rule Method):</strong> This method describes the property or properties that all elements of the set satisfy. It is particularly useful for infinite sets or when listing all elements would be cumbersome or impossible.</p>\n<p>Example: A = {x | x is a natural number less than 6} — read as \"the set of all x such that x is a natural number less than 6.\"</p>\n<p>Example: B = {x ∈ ℝ | x² = 4} — the set of real numbers whose square equals 4, which is {2, -2}.</p>\n<p>Example: C = {2n | n ∈ ℕ} — the set of even natural numbers.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Number Sets</h3>\n<p>Throughout mathematics, certain sets of numbers appear so frequently that they have standard names and notations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} — Natural numbers (sometimes including 0, depending on convention)</li>\n<li>ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} — Integers</li>\n<li>ℚ = {p/q | p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0} — Rational numbers (fractions)</li>\n<li>ℝ — Real numbers (all numbers on the number line)</li>\n<li>ℂ — Complex numbers (numbers of the form a + bi, where i² = -1)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Types of Sets</h3>\n<p>Sets can be classified in several important ways based on their characteristics:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Empty Set (Null Set):</strong> A set containing no elements, denoted by ∅ or {}. This set plays a role analogous to zero in arithmetic. Examples: {x | x ≠ x} (no object is different from itself), {x ∈ ℝ | x² < 0} (no real number has a negative square).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finite Set:</strong> A set with a countable number of elements, meaning we can list all elements and the listing process terminates. Example: {a, b, c, d} has 4 elements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Infinite Set:</strong> A set with an uncountable number of elements, meaning we cannot list all elements—the listing would never end. Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} (natural numbers) is infinite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Equal Sets:</strong> Two sets A and B are equal (written A = B) if they contain exactly the same elements. The order in which elements are listed does not matter, and repeated elements are counted only once. For example, {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3}.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Equivalent Sets:</strong> Two sets are equivalent if they have the same number of elements (same cardinality), regardless of what those elements are. For example, {a, b, c} and {1, 2, 3} are equivalent because both have 3 elements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Universal Set:</strong> The set containing all elements under consideration in a particular context, denoted by U. This set provides the universe of discourse for a given problem. For example, when discussing student grades, the universal set might be all students in a school.</p>\n\n<h3>Cardinality of a Set</h3>\n<p>The number of elements in a finite set A is called its cardinality, denoted by n(A) or |A|. Cardinality is a measure of set size and is fundamental to counting problems.</p>\n<p>Example: If A = {a, b, c, d}, then n(A) = 4</p>\n<p>Example: If B = {x ∈ ℕ | x < 10}, then n(B) = 9</p>\n<p>For infinite sets, cardinality becomes more subtle—for instance, the set of natural numbers and the set of even numbers have the same cardinality (both are \"countably infinite\"), even though one is a proper subset of the other.</p>\n\n<h2>Relationships Between Sets</h2>\n\n<h3>Subset</h3>\n<p>A set A is a subset of B (written A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B. This relationship expresses the idea that A is contained within B. The subset relationship is one of the most important concepts in set theory.</p>\n\n<p>If A ⊆ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, written A ⊂ B. This means that A is contained in B, but B contains at least one element not in A.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>{1, 2} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4} (proper subset)</li>\n<li>{a, b} ⊆ {a, b} (subset, but not proper)</li>\n<li>The set of even numbers is a proper subset of the set of integers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Properties of Subsets:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every set is a subset of itself: A ⊆ A (reflexive property)</li>\n<li>The empty set is a subset of every set: ∅ ⊆ A (vacuously true, since there are no elements to check)</li>\n<li>If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C (transitive property)</li>\n<li>If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then A = B (antisymmetric property)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Power Set: The Set of All Subsets</h3>\n<p>The power set of A, denoted P(A) or 2ᴬ, is the set of all subsets of A. This concept demonstrates how sets can have sets as elements and reveals the exponential growth of possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>If n(A) = n, then n(P(A)) = 2ⁿ — each element of A can either be included or excluded from any given subset, giving 2 choices for each of n elements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<p>If A = ∅, then P(A) = {∅} — the power set contains only the empty set. n(P(A)) = 2⁰ = 1</p>\n<p>If A = {a}, then P(A) = {∅, {a}} — n(P(A)) = 2¹ = 2</p>\n<p>If A = {a, b}, then P(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} — n(P(A)) = 2² = 4</p>\n<p>If A = {a, b, c}, then P(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}} — n(P(A)) = 2³ = 8</p>\n\n<h2>Set Operations</h2>\n\n<h3>Union (∪)</h3>\n<p>The union of sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to A or B or both. The union combines all elements from both sets, removing duplicates.</p>\n<p>A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>\n\n<h3>Intersection (∩)</h3>\n<p>The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to both A and B. The intersection identifies what the sets share in common.</p>\n<p>A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> With A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, A ∩ B = {3, 4}</p>\n<p>If A ∩ B = ∅, then A and B are called disjoint sets—they have no elements in common.</p>\n\n<h3>Complement (A' or Aᶜ)</h3>\n<p>The complement of A is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. This operation requires a universal set to be meaningful.</p>\n<p>Aᶜ = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, then Aᶜ = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}</p>\n\n<h3>Difference (A - B or A \\ B)</h3>\n<p>The difference of A and B (also called the relative complement of B in A) is the set of elements that are in A but not in B.</p>\n<p>A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, then A - B = {1, 2}</p>\n<p>Note that A - B is generally different from B - A, which would be {5, 6} in this example.</p>\n\n<h3>Symmetric Difference (A Δ B)</h3>\n<p>The symmetric difference of A and B is the set of elements that are in either A or B but not in both. This operation captures the notion of exclusive or (XOR).</p>\n<p>A Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, then A Δ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}</p>\n\n<h2>Venn Diagrams</h2>\n<p>Venn diagrams, invented by John Venn in 1880, are visual representations of sets using circles or other closed curves inside a rectangle representing the universal set. These diagrams provide intuitive understanding of set operations and relationships.</p>\n\n<p>In a Venn diagram:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The universal set is represented by a rectangle.</li>\n<li>Sets are represented by circles (or other shapes) inside the rectangle.</li>\n<li>Elements are not typically drawn; rather, regions represent the presence or absence of elements.</li>\n<li>Overlapping regions show intersections between sets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Common Venn diagram configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two sets: Two overlapping circles create 4 regions (A only, B only, both A and B, neither)</li>\n<li>Three sets: Three overlapping circles create 8 regions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Laws of Set Algebra</h2>\n<p>These laws govern how sets interact and are analogous to the laws of arithmetic for numbers. They are essential for simplifying complex set expressions and proving set identities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Identity Laws:</strong> These laws establish the roles of the empty set and universal set as identity elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ ∅ = A (∅ is identity for union)</li>\n<li>A ∩ U = A (U is identity for intersection)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Domination Laws:</strong> These laws show how the empty set and universal set dominate operations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ U = U (union with universal set yields universal set)</li>\n<li>A ∩ ∅ = ∅ (intersection with empty set yields empty set)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Idempotent Laws:</strong> A set combined with itself yields itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ A = A</li>\n<li>A ∩ A = A</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>4. Complement Laws:</strong> These laws define the fundamental properties of complements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ Aᶜ = U (law of excluded middle—every element is either in A or its complement)</li>\n<li>A ∩ Aᶜ = ∅ (law of non-contradiction—no element can be both in A and its complement)</li>\n<li>(Aᶜ)ᶜ = A (involution—complement of complement returns original set)</li>\n<li>Uᶜ = ∅, ∅ᶜ = U (complements of extremes)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>5. Commutative Laws:</strong> Order doesn't matter for union and intersection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ B = B ∪ A</li>\n<li>A ∩ B = B ∩ A</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>6. Associative Laws:</strong> Grouping doesn't matter for union and intersection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)</li>\n<li>(A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>7. Distributive Laws:</strong> These laws show how union and intersection distribute over each other—crucial for algebraic manipulation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) (union distributes over intersection)</li>\n<li>A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) (intersection distributes over union)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>8. De Morgan's Laws:</strong> These fundamental laws relate complements of unions and intersections—named after Augustus De Morgan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ (the complement of a union is the intersection of complements)</li>\n<li>(A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ (the complement of an intersection is the union of complements)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>9. Absorption Laws:</strong> These laws show how certain combinations simplify.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A</li>\n<li>A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Cartesian Product</h2>\n<p>The Cartesian product of sets A and B, denoted A × B (read as \"A cross B\"), is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Named after René Descartes, this operation is fundamental to coordinate geometry, relations, and functions.</p>\n<p>A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key points about Cartesian products:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order matters: (a, b) ≠ (b, a) unless a = b</li>\n<li>If n(A) = m and n(B) = n, then n(A × B) = m × n</li>\n<li>A × B is generally different from B × A (not commutative)</li>\n<li>The Cartesian product can be extended to more than two sets: A × B × C = {(a, b, c) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C}</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<p>If A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y}, then:</p>\n<p>A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}</p>\n<p>B × A = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (y, 1), (y, 2)}</p>\n\n<p>The Cartesian product ℝ × ℝ gives the familiar xy-coordinate plane, where each point is represented by an ordered pair (x, y).</p>\n\n<h2>Applications of Set Theory</h2>\n\n<h3>Word Problems Involving Sets</h3>\n<p>Set theory provides powerful tools for solving counting problems involving overlapping categories. The fundamental principle is the inclusion-exclusion principle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For two sets A and B:</strong></p>\n<p>n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B)</p>\n<p>We subtract the intersection because elements in both sets are counted twice when we add n(A) and n(B).</p>\n\n<p><strong>For three sets:</strong></p>\n<p>n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A ∩ B) - n(A ∩ C) - n(B ∩ C) + n(A ∩ B ∩ C)</p>\n\n<p>Here, we add back the triple intersection because it was subtracted too many times.</p>\n\n<h3>Applications in Computer Science</h3>\n<p>1. Database queries use set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)\n2. Relational algebra is built on set theory\n3. Type theory in programming languages uses set concepts\n4. Boolean algebra, essential for digital circuit design, is isomorphic to set algebra</p>\n\n<h3>Applications in Probability</h3>\n<p>Probability theory is built on set theory, with events represented as sets and probability measures satisfying set-based axioms.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Real Number System and Mathematical Induction</h1>\n\n<h2>The Real Number System</h2>\n<p>The real number system is the set of all numbers that can be represented on an infinite number line. Understanding the hierarchy and properties of real numbers is fundamental to all of mathematics, from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus.</p>\n\n<h3>Classification of Numbers</h3>\n<p>The real numbers are organized into a hierarchical structure, with each level adding new types of numbers while preserving the properties of the levels below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Numbers (ℕ):</strong> {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} These are the counting numbers, the first numbers humanity ever used. Some definitions include 0 (ℕ₀ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}), but traditionally ℕ starts at 1. Natural numbers are closed under addition and multiplication but not under subtraction (e.g., 3 - 5 is not a natural number).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whole Numbers (𝕎):</strong> {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} This set adds 0 to the natural numbers. Zero, originating from ancient Indian mathematics, represents the concept of nothingness and serves as the additive identity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Integers (ℤ):</strong> {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} The integers extend whole numbers by including negative numbers, which represent debts, temperatures below zero, and positions to the left of zero on the number line. The letter ℤ comes from the German \"Zahlen,\" meaning numbers. Integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not under division.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rational Numbers (ℚ):</strong> Numbers that can be expressed as p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0. The letter ℚ stands for \"quotient.\" Rational numbers include all integers (as fractions with denominator 1), terminating decimals (e.g., 0.75 = 3/4), and repeating decimals (e.g., 0.333... = 1/3). Key properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can always be written in lowest terms (reduced form)</li>\n<li>Between any two rational numbers, there exists another rational number (density property)</li>\n<li>They are closed under all four arithmetic operations (except division by zero)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> 2/3, -5/2, 0.75, 4 (= 4/1), 0.333... (= 1/3)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Irrational Numbers (ℚᶜ):</strong> Numbers that cannot be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers. These numbers have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansions. Their discovery by the ancient Greeks (specifically the Pythagoreans discovering that √2 is irrational) was revolutionary and initially kept secret. Irrational numbers fill the \"gaps\" between rational numbers on the number line.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>√2 ≈ 1.4142135623... (first number proven irrational)</li>\n<li>π ≈ 3.1415926535... (ratio of circumference to diameter)</li>\n<li>e ≈ 2.7182818284... (base of natural logarithms)</li>\n<li>√3 ≈ 1.7320508075...</li>\n<li>φ (golden ratio) ≈ 1.6180339887...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Real Numbers (ℝ):</strong> The union of rational and irrational numbers. Every point on the number line corresponds to a real number, and every real number corresponds to a point on the number line—this is called the completeness property. The set ℝ forms a continuum with no gaps.</p>\n\n<h3>Properties of Real Numbers</h3>\n<p>These properties, sometimes called the field axioms, define how real numbers behave under addition and multiplication. They are so fundamental that we use them automatically without thinking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Closure Properties:</strong> Operations on real numbers always yield real numbers (except division by zero).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a, b ∈ ℝ, then a + b ∈ ℝ</li>\n<li>If a, b ∈ ℝ, then a × b ∈ ℝ</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Commutative Properties:</strong> The order of operands doesn't affect the result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a + b = b + a (addition commutes)</li>\n<li>a × b = b × a (multiplication commutes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subtraction and division are not commutative: a - b ≠ b - a generally, and a ÷ b ≠ b ÷ a generally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Associative Properties:</strong> The grouping of operations doesn't affect the result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (addition associates)</li>\n<li>(a × b) × c = a × (b × c) (multiplication associates)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This property allows us to write a + b + c without parentheses—the meaning is unambiguous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Distributive Property:</strong> This property links addition and multiplication, and is the reason our number system works the way it does.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c (multiplication distributes over addition)</li>\n<li>(a + b) × c = a × c + b × c (right distributivity follows from commutativity)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Identity Elements:</strong> Special numbers that leave other numbers unchanged under operation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additive Identity:</strong> a + 0 = a (0 is the additive identity). Zero added to any number yields that number.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiplicative Identity:</strong> a × 1 = a (1 is the multiplicative identity). One multiplied by any number yields that number.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inverse Elements:</strong> Numbers that combine with a given number to yield the identity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additive Inverse:</strong> a + (-a) = 0 (-a is the additive inverse of a). Every real number has an additive inverse.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiplicative Inverse:</strong> a × (1/a) = 1, provided a ≠ 0 (1/a is the multiplicative inverse of a). Every non-zero real number has a multiplicative inverse (reciprocal).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Order Properties:</strong> Real numbers can be compared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trichotomy Law:</strong> For any real numbers a and b, exactly one of the following holds: a < b, a = b, or a > b. This property ensures that the real numbers are totally ordered.</li>\n<li><strong>Transitive Property:</strong> If a < b and b < c, then a < c. This allows us to chain inequalities.</li>\n<li><strong>Addition Property of Order:</strong> If a < b, then a + c < b + c for any real c.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiplication Property of Order:</strong> If a < b and c > 0, then ac < bc. If c < 0, the inequality reverses: ac > bc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Density of Rational and Irrational Numbers</h3>\n<p>A remarkable property of real numbers is that between any two distinct real numbers, there exists both a rational number and an irrational number. This means that rational and irrational numbers are interwoven throughout the number line—there are no intervals containing only one type.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Between 1 and 2, we have rationals like 1.5, 1.75, 1.333..., and irrationals like √2 ≈ 1.414, √3 ≈ 1.732, π/2 ≈ 1.571.</p>\n\n<h2>Mathematical Induction</h2>\n<p>Mathematical induction is a powerful proof technique used to establish that a statement holds for all natural numbers. It's analogous to an infinite row of dominoes—if you can knock down the first one and show that each domino knocks down the next, then all dominoes will fall.</p>\n\n<h3>Principle of Mathematical Induction</h3>\n<p>The principle states: If a statement P(n) is true for n = 1 (or some base case), and whenever P(k) is true for some positive integer k, then P(k + 1) is also true, then P(n) is true for all positive integers n.</p>\n\n<p>This works because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>P(1) is true (base case)</li>\n<li>Since P(1) is true, P(2) must be true (inductive step with k = 1)</li>\n<li>Since P(2) is true, P(3) must be true (inductive step with k = 2)</li>\n<li>And so on, like a chain reaction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Four Essential Steps in Mathematical Induction</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Base Case</strong> — Prove that the statement is true for the smallest value, usually n = 1. Sometimes the base case might be n = 0 or n = 2, depending on the statement. This step establishes the starting point of the induction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis</strong> — Assume that the statement is true for n = k, where k is some positive integer (usually k ≥ the base case). This is not an assumption that the statement is true for all n—it's a conditional assumption: \"if it's true for k, then...\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Inductive Step</strong> — Prove that the statement is true for n = k + 1 using the inductive hypothesis. This is the heart of the proof, where you show that truth propagates from one case to the next.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Conclusion</strong> — By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n (or for all n ≥ the base case).</p>\n\n<h3>Detailed Examples of Proof by Induction</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1: Sum of First n Natural Numbers</strong></p>\n<p>Prove that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 for all n ∈ ℕ</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Base Case (n = 1):</em> LHS = 1, RHS = 1(2)/2 = 1.

Making an invalid inductive step:</strong> The inductive step must work for all k ≥ the base case. Sometimes the reasoning only works for k above a certain threshold, and additional base cases are needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Using the statement to prove itself (circular reasoning):</strong> The inductive hypothesis should be used exactly as assumed—not assuming P(k+1) to prove P(k+1).</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Assuming what needs to be proved:</strong> This is a form of circular reasoning. For example, starting with the conclusion and manipulating it until you reach something true doesn't constitute a valid proof.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

This seemingly obvious fact is actually a fundamental property of the natural numbers and is equivalent to the principle of induction.</p>"

Intuitively, a sequence is an ordered list of numbers: a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ, ... where the order matters and the pattern of terms follows a specific rule. The nth term of a sequence is denoted by aₙ or uₙ, and the entire sequence is often written as {aₙ} or (aₙ).</p>\n\n<p>Sequences appear throughout mathematics and nature: the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...), the sequence of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), or the sequence of decimal digits of π (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...).</p>\n\n<h3>Types of Sequences</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Finite Sequence:</strong> A sequence with a finite number of terms. Example: {2, 4, 6, 8} (first four even numbers).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Infinite Sequence:</strong> A sequence with an infinite number of terms. Example: {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...} (reciprocals of natural numbers).</p>\n\n<h3>Ways to Define a Sequence</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. Explicit Formula:</strong> The nth term is given by a formula in n. Example: aₙ = 2n gives {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Recursive Definition:</strong> Each term is defined in terms of previous terms, along with initial conditions. Example: Fibonacci: F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Descriptive Definition:</strong> Terms are described in words. Example: \"The sequence of prime numbers.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Arithmetic Sequences (Arithmetic Progression - AP)</h2>\n\n<p>An arithmetic sequence is one of the most fundamental types of sequences. It is characterized by a constant difference between consecutive terms.</p>\n\n<h3>Definition</h3>\n<p>A sequence in which each term is obtained by adding a constant (called the common difference, denoted by d) to the preceding term. If the first term is a, then:</p>\n<p>General form: a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...

From projectile motion to optimization problems, quadratics appear throughout science, engineering, and economics.</p>\n\n<p>The general form of a quadratic equation is:</p>\n<p><strong>ax² + bx + c = 0</strong>, where a, b, c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.</p>\n\n<p>The requirement a ≠ 0 is essential—if a = 0, the equation becomes linear (bx + c = 0). The coefficients have specific names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>a</strong> is the coefficient of x² (quadratic coefficient)</li>\n<li><strong>b</strong> is the coefficient of x (linear coefficient)</li>\n<li><strong>c</strong> is the constant term</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Types of Quadratic Equations</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Pure Quadratic Equation:</strong> When the linear term is missing (b = 0), the equation becomes ax² + c = 0. These are the simplest quadratics to solve.</p>\n<p>Example: x² - 25 = 0 (a = 1, b = 0, c = -25)</p>\n<p>Example: 4x² - 9 = 0 (a = 4, b = 0, c = -9)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Affected Quadratic Equation:</strong> When all terms are present (b ≠ 0), the equation is of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.</p>\n<p>Example: 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0</p>\n<p>Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0</p>\n\n<h2>Methods of Solving Quadratic Equations</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Factorization Method</h3>\n<p>This method relies on expressing the quadratic as a product of linear factors. It works when the quadratic has rational roots and when the factors are relatively easy to find.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step-by-step process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write the equation in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0</li>\n<li>Find two numbers whose product is ac and whose sum is b</li>\n<li>Split the middle term using these numbers</li>\n<li>Factor by grouping</li>\n<li>Set each factor equal to zero and solve</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0</p>\n<p>Find two numbers with product 6 and sum -5: these are -2 and -3</p>\n<p>x² - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0</p>\n<p>x(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0</p>\n<p>(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0</p>\n<p>Therefore, x = 2 or x = 3</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Solve 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0</p>\n<p>Here a = 2, c = 3, so ac = 6. Need two numbers with product 6 and sum -7: these are -1 and -6</p>\n<p>2x² - 6x - x + 3 = 0</p>\n<p>2x(x - 3) - 1(x - 3) = 0</p>\n<p>(x - 3)(2x - 1) = 0</p>\n<p>Therefore, x = 3 or x = 1/2</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Solve 6x² + 5x - 6 = 0</p>\n<p>ac = -36, need two numbers with product -36 and sum 5: these are 9 and -4</p>\n<p>6x² + 9x - 4x - 6 = 0</p>\n<p>3x(2x + 3) - 2(2x + 3) = 0</p>\n<p>(2x + 3)(3x - 2) = 0</p>\n<p>Therefore, x = -3/2 or x = 2/3</p>\n\n<h3>2. Completing the Square Method</h3>\n<p>This method transforms the equation into the form (x + p)² = q, from which solutions can be found by taking square roots. It's a systematic approach that always works and leads to the quadratic formula.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step-by-step process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a ≠ 1, divide the entire equation by a</li>\n<li>Move the constant term to the right side</li>\n<li>Add (b/2)² to both sides (where b is the coefficient after dividing)</li>\n<li>Write the left side as a perfect square</li>\n<li>Take square roots (remembering ±)</li>\n<li>Solve for x</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Solve x² + 6x - 7 = 0</p>\n<p>Step 1: a = 1 already, so no division needed.</p>\n<p>Step 2: x² + 6x = 7</p>\n<p>Step 3: Half of 6 is 3, square is 9.

Add 4: x² - 4x + 4 = -5/2 + 4 = -5/2 + 8/2 = 3/2</p>\n<p>Step 4: (x - 2)² = 3/2</p>\n<p>Step 5: x - 2 = ±√(3/2) = ±√6/2</p>\n<p>Step 6: x = 2 ± √6/2 = (4 ± √6)/2</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Solve 3x² + 5x - 2 = 0</p>\n<p>Step 1: Divide by 3: x² + (5/3)x - 2/3 = 0</p>\n<p>Step 2: x² + (5/3)x = 2/3</p>\n<p>Step 3: Half of 5/3 is 5/6, square is 25/36. Add: x² + (5/3)x + 25/36 = 2/3 + 25/36 = 24/36 + 25/36 = 49/36</p>\n<p>Step 4: (x + 5/6)² = 49/36</p>\n<p>Step 5: x + 5/6 = ±7/6</p>\n<p>Step 6: x = -5/6 ± 7/6 ⇒ x = 2/6 = 1/3 or x = -12/6 = -2</p>\n\n<h3>3.

This theorem, discovered independently by mathematicians across cultures (including the Persian mathematician Al-Karaji and later Newton), is fundamental to combinatorics, probability, and algebra.</p>\n\n<p>Before the theorem, expanding (x + y)⁵ would require multiplying (x + y) by itself five times—a tedious process. The binomial theorem gives us a direct way to write the expansion with predetermined coefficients.</p>\n\n<h2>Binomial Coefficients</h2>\n\n<p>The coefficients in the expansion of (1 + x)ⁿ are called binomial coefficients. They appear in many areas of mathematics and have several notations:</p>\n<p><strong>C(n, r) or ⁿCᵣ or ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Definition and Formula</h3>\n<p>The binomial coefficient ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠ (read as \"n choose r\") is defined as:</p>\n<p><strong>⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠ = n! / [r!(n - r)!], where 0 ≤ r ≤ n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here, n! (n factorial) represents the product of all positive integers from 1 to n:</p>\n<p>n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1, with the special definition 0! = 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>⎛⎝⁵₂⎞⎠ = 5!/(2!3!) = (5×4×3×2×1)/((2×1)(3×2×1)) = 120/(2×6) = 120/12 = 10</li>\n<li>⎛⎝⁴₀⎞⎠ = 4!/(0!4!) = 24/(1×24) = 1</li>\n<li>⎛⎝⁶₃⎞⎠ = 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6×6) = 720/36 = 20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Properties of Binomial Coefficients</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Property 1 (Symmetry):</strong> ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝ⁿₙ₋ᵣ⎞⎠</p>\n<p>This follows from the formula: n!/(r!(n-r)!) = n!/((n-r)!r!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property 2 (Boundary Values):</strong> ⎛⎝ⁿ₀⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝ⁿₙ⎞⎠ = 1</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property 3 (Second Values):</strong> ⎛⎝ⁿ₁⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝ⁿₙ₋₁⎞⎠ = n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property 4 (Pascal's Identity):</strong> ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ₊₁⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝ⁿ⁺¹ᵣ₊₁⎞⎠</p>\n<p>This identity forms the basis of Pascal's triangle and can be proven algebraically:</p>\n<p>⎛⎝ⁿᵣ⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝ⁿᵣ₊₁⎞⎠ = n!/(r!(n-r)!) + n!/((r+1)!(n-r-1)!)</p>\n<p>= n!/(r!(n-r-1)!) × [1/(n-r) + 1/(r+1)] = n!/(r!(n-r-1)!) × [(r+1 + n-r)/((n-r)(r+1))]</p>\n<p>= n!/(r!(n-r-1)!) × (n+1)/((n-r)(r+1)) = (n+1)!/((r+1)!(n-r)!) = ⎛⎝ⁿ⁺¹ᵣ₊₁⎞⎠</p>\n\n<h2>Pascal's Triangle</h2>\n\n<p>Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients that reveals many fascinating patterns. Each row corresponds to the coefficients in the expansion of (x + y)ⁿ for n = 0, 1, 2, ...</p>\n\n<pre>\n               1               n=0\n             1   1             n=1\n           1   2   1           n=2\n         1   3   3   1         n=3\n       1   4   6   4   1       n=4\n     1   5  10  10   5   1     n=5\n   1   6  15  20  15   6   1   n=6\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Properties of Pascal's Triangle</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Construction Rule:</strong> Each number (except the 1's on the edges) is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This is a visual representation of Pascal's identity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Row Sums:</strong> The sum of the numbers in row n is 2ⁿ. For example, row 3: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8 = 2³.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternating Sums:</strong> The alternating sum of a row is 0 for n ≥ 1. For example, row 4: 1 - 4 + 6 - 4 + 1 = 0.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fibonacci Connection:</strong> Sums of diagonal entries yield Fibonacci numbers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powers of 11:</strong> Reading row n as digits (with carries) gives 11ⁿ.

So no x⁴ term exists.</p>\n\n<h3>3.

        "content": "<h1>Circular Measure and Trigonometric Functions</h1>\n\n<h2>Circular Measure (Radians)</h2>\n\n<p>While degrees are familiar (360° in a circle), radians provide a more natural and mathematically convenient way to measure angles. The radian measure arises directly from the geometry of the circle itself.</p>\n\n<h3>Definition of a Radian</h3>\n<p>One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. In other words, if you take the radius and wrap it around the circumference, the angle at the center is exactly 1 radian.</p>\n\n<p>This definition ties angle measure directly to arc length, making it natural for calculus and many areas of mathematics.</p>\n\n<h3>Relationship between Degrees and Radians</h3>\n<p>Since the circumference of a circle is 2πr, the number of radians in a full circle is (2πr)/r = 2π. Therefore:</p>\n<p><strong>2π radians = 360°</strong></p>\n<p><strong>π radians = 180°</strong></p>\n\n<p>From these relationships, we get conversion formulas:</p>\n<p><strong>To convert degrees to radians:</strong> multiply by π/180</p>\n<p><strong>To convert radians to degrees:</strong> multiply by 180/π</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>30° = 30 × π/180 = π/6 radians</li>\n<li>45° = π/4 radians</li>\n<li>60° = π/3 radians</li>\n<li>90° = π/2 radians</li>\n<li>180° = π radians</li>\n<li>360° = 2π radians</li>\n<li>1 radian = 180/π ≈ 57.2958°</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Arc Length Formula</h3>\n<p>One of the most important advantages of radians is the simple formula for arc length:</p>\n<p><strong>s = rθ</strong>, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>s = arc length</li>\n<li>r = radius</li>\n<li>θ = angle in radians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This formula is simple because the radian measure directly represents the ratio of arc length to radius.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the arc length of a sector with radius 5 cm and angle 2.4 radians.</p>\n<p>s = rθ = 5 × 2.4 = 12 cm</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the angle in radians that subtends an arc of length 8 cm in a circle of radius 10 cm.</p>\n<p>θ = s/r = 8/10 = 0.8 radians ≈ 45.84°</p>\n\n<h3>Area of a Sector</h3>\n<p>The area of a sector (the region bounded by two radii and the included arc) also has a simple formula in radians:</p>\n<p><strong>A = ½ r²θ</strong></p>\n\n<p>This can be derived from the fact that the area of the full circle (πr²) corresponds to an angle of 2π radians, so the area for angle θ is (θ/(2π)) × πr² = ½ r²θ.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the area of a sector with radius 8 cm and angle 1.5 radians.</p>\n<p>A = ½ × 8² × 1.5 = ½ × 64 × 1.5 = 32 × 1.5 = 48 cm²</p>\n\n<h3>Area of a Segment</h3>\n<p>A segment is the region between a chord and its arc. Its area can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord from the sector area:</p>\n<p><strong>Area of segment = Area of sector - Area of triangle</strong></p>\n<p>= ½ r²θ - ½ r² sin θ = ½ r²(θ - sin θ)</p>\n\n<p>This formula is valid when θ is in radians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the area of the segment in a circle of radius 10 cm with central angle 1.2 radians.</p>\n<p>Area = ½ × 10² × (1.2 - sin 1.2) = 50 × (1.2 - 0.9320) = 50 × 0.2680 = 13.4 cm²</p>\n\n<h2>Trigonometric Ratios</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Ratios in a Right Triangle</h3>\n<p>In a right triangle, for an acute angle θ, the six trigonometric ratios are defined as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse</strong></li>\n<li><strong>cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse</strong></li>\n<li><strong>tan θ = opposite/adjacent</strong></li>\n<li><strong>cosec θ = 1/sin θ = hypotenuse/opposite</strong></li>\n<li><strong>sec θ = 1/cos θ = hypotenuse/adjacent</strong></li>\n<li><strong>cot θ = 1/tan θ = adjacent/opposite</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These definitions form the foundation of trigonometry and are extended to all angles using the unit circle.</p>\n\n<h3>Exact Values for Special Angles</h3>\n<p>Certain angles have trigonometric ratios that can be expressed exactly using radicals.

Heights and Distances</h3>\n<p>Trigonometry is essential for measuring inaccessible heights and distances using angles of elevation and depression.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Angle of elevation:</strong> angle above the horizontal from observer to object</p>\n<p><strong>Angle of depression:</strong> angle below the horizontal from observer to object</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> From a point 100 m from the base of a tower, the angle of elevation to the top is 30°. Find the height of the tower.</p>\n<p>tan 30° = height/100 ⇒ height = 100 × tan 30° = 100 × (1/√3) ≈ 57.74 m</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person on top of a 50 m building observes a car at an angle of depression of 20°. How far is the car from the building?</p>\n<p>tan 20° = 50/distance ⇒ distance = 50/tan 20° ≈ 50/0.3640 ≈ 137.36 m</p>\n\n<h3>2. Sine and Cosine Rules (for non-right triangles)</h3>\n\n<p>For any triangle ABC with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sine Rule:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R</strong>, where R is the circumradius (radius of the circle passing through all three vertices).</p>\n<p>This rule is used when we know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two angles and one side (AAS or ASA)</li>\n<li>Two sides and a non-included angle (SSA — the ambiguous case)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cosine Rule:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>b² = a² + c² - 2ac cos B</strong></p>\n<p><strong>c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C</strong></p>\n<p>This rule is used when we know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two sides and the included angle (SAS)</li>\n<li>Three sides (SSS)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example (Sine Rule):</strong> In triangle ABC, A = 40°, B = 60°, and side a = 10 cm. Find side b.</p>\n<p>a/sin A = b/sin B ⇒ 10/sin 40° = b/sin 60°</p>\n<p>b = 10 × sin 60°/sin 40° = 10 × 0.8660/0.6428 ≈ 13.47 cm</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example (Cosine Rule):</strong> In triangle ABC, a = 7 cm, b = 8 cm, and C = 45°. Find side c.</p>\n<p>c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C = 49 + 64 - 2(7)(8)(cos 45°) = 113 - 112 × 0.7071 = 113 - 79.2 = 33.8</p>\n<p>c = √33.8 ≈ 5.81 cm</p>\n\n<h3>3. Area of Triangle</h3>\n<p>Trigonometry provides formulas for the area of a triangle when height is not directly known:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Area = ½ ab sin C = ½ bc sin A = ½ ac sin B</strong></p>\n\n<p>This formula gives the area as half the product of two sides and the sine of the included angle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the area of triangle with sides a = 10 cm, b = 14 cm, and included angle C = 30°.</p>\n<p>Area = ½ × 10 × 14 × sin 30° = 70 × 0.5 = 35 cm²</p>\n\n<h3>4. Waves and Oscillations</h3>\n<p>Trigonometric functions are the natural language for describing periodic phenomena in physics and engineering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple harmonic motion:</strong> displacement = A sin(ωt + φ) or A cos(ωt + φ)</li>\n<li><strong>Sound waves:</strong> pressure variations as sine waves of different frequencies</li>\n<li><strong>Alternating current:</strong> voltage = V₀ sin(ωt)</li>\n<li><strong>Light waves:</strong> electromagnetic waves described by sine functions</li>\n<li><strong>Tides:</strong> periodic rise and fall modeled by trigonometric functions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> The displacement of a particle in simple harmonic motion is given by x = 5 sin(2πt), where x is in cm and t in seconds. Find the amplitude, period, and displacement at t = 0.25 s.</p>\n<p>Amplitude = 5 cm, Period = 2π/2π = 1 second</p>\n<p>At t = 0.25: x = 5 sin(2π × 0.25) = 5 sin(π/2) = 5 × 1 = 5 cm</p>"
